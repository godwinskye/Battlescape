# Jazz In Hell

## Inspired by Ben Tristem's Escape Project, a very simple escape game with 10 rooms and a garden

This game is my first very small project that helps me understand some basic elements of game programming in general, along with Unreal Engine 4.
The game contains 10 rooms with spotlights, whereby you can move objects into them to help you escape from one room to another, all the way until
you reach the *victory point*, which is a garden.

######Assets used in this game are from the Starter Content and also from the [Vegetation Pack](https://forums.unrealengine.com/showthread.php?59812-FREE-Foliage-Starter-Kit) and some grass from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaCQWUL0Htw)

All assets are obtained for free and this project is merely for personal use/development.
